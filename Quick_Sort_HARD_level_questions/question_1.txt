Problem Statement

Maria is managing a scheduling system that records various time-points throughout the day. She needs to determine the shortest interval between any two recorded times. By converting the time-points into minutes and sorting them using QuickSort, she can efficiently calculate the minimum difference. Help Maria find the smallest interval between any two times in the list.

Input format :

The first line of input consists of an integer n, representing the number of time-points in the list.
The next n lines each contain a string in the format "HH:MM", representing a time-point.

Output format :

The output prints "The time difference is: " followed by a single integer, representing the minimum minute difference between any two time points in the list.


Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
2 ≤ n ≤ 100

Each time-point is in the format "HH:MM".

Sample Test Case:

Input: 
2 
23:59
00:00

Output:
The time difference is: 1
